# beamer_uchicago
A not terrible Beamer template for the University of Chicago.

`deck_template.tex` -> the template.

`phoenix.pdf`       -> phoenix logo.

`uchi_logo.pdf`     -> title slide logo.

`example_deck.pdf`  -> example slide deck.


Also, I know this isn't a .sty file - I suspect it won't get enough use to justify that. To use it, just download/clone the three files, and everything should work from there.

Both the logo and Phoenix are .pdfs converted from .svgs, so you can zoom-in to infinity and not worry about pixelation.
